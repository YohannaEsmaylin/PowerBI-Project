**Project Type:** Data analysis & Dashboard Design

**Tools used:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX

**Datasets:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-conversion-in-digital-marketing-dataset)

# 🧠 Overview
This Power BI project visualises and analyses a synthetic digital marketing dataset to evaluate the performance of various campaigns and channels. It provides actionable insights into ad spend efficiency, conversion performance, and channel effectiveness to guide strategic decision-making.
# 🔍 Key Metrics Tracked
* Total Ad Spend

* Conversion Count

* Click-Through Rate (CTR)

* Cost per Acquisition (CPA)

* Conversion Rate by Campaign Channel

Engagement (Time on Site) by Campaign Type
# 📌 Key Findings
* Referral and PPC campaigns had the highest conversion rates, indicating stronger performance in converting leads.

* Retention campaigns had the lowest engagement and conversion levels, suggesting a need for redesign or optimisation.

* Conversion-type campaigns were the most effective in driving both time on site and total conversions.

* Despite a $ 40 M+ ad spend, CPA remained high, revealing inefficiencies in media allocation.

# ⚠️ Challenges Faced
* Incomplete or “blank” values in Ad Spend and CTR visualisations required special handling and filtering to avoid misleading insights.

* Ensuring visual clarity while incorporating multiple metrics (e.g., CTR, CPA, conversions) across different campaign types.

* Designing interactivity with filters (age, gender, campaign types) without overwhelming the dashboard.
# 📈 Visualisations Included
* KPI cards for a high-level overview

* Line & bar charts for time and conversion trends

* Doughnut chart for campaign type contribution

* Bubble chart comparing Ad Spend vs Conversion vs CTR

* Interactive filters by Gender, Age, Campaign Channel, and Type
